			<h4>Toronto's Soccer spirit: modern day Pangea</h4>
				
				<p>4 years ago I was working for my student paper, and the 2010 World Cup had just begun in South Africa. Summer was in full swing, and throughout the city every store with a television had people lining the streets trying to watch the games.</p>
				
				<p>There are few things like experiencing a world cup in Toronto. Throughout the days of the World Cup, roars are heard wherever you go. Neighborhoods are painted with flags. Plenty of dancing is done.</p>

				<p>Toronto sits like a modern day Pangea, neighborhoods representing homes for over a hundred nations that have come to live in the city.</p>

				<p>We decided in the newsroom to cover a community that had intense ties to soccer. Ghana it was. The Ghanese team had drawn the Americans in a quarter-final elimination match that would pit the two underdogs against each other.</p>

				<p>The assignment was simple: capture Toronto's soccer spirit. I ended up heading to the north end of the city in the basement of a the wonderful <a href="http://www.mamapees.com/">Mama Pee's restaurant</a> on Jane Street, near where many Ghanese who now call Toronto home live. The only colors that I could make out in the limited lighting (which mostly came from the TVs) were Ghanese's red, yellow, and green.</p>
				
				<p>The Toronto heat didn't seem to bother anyone. With the score tied 1-1 after regulation, the excitement only drew more intense as everyone knew the next goal was the only thing that mattered. But it didn't take long for Ghana to score the winner.</p>

				<p>The game ended, Ghana had won 2-1. The party had just begun.</p>
